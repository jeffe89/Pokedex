# Pokedex ðŸ§­
A command-line PokÃ©dex written in Go, offering an interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) that allows users to explore PokÃ©mon data using the PokÃ©API. It includes data caching and various commands to navigate, inspect, and catch PokÃ©mon.

## Features
- REPL interface to issue commands like `map`, `explore`, `inspect`, and more  
- Caching mechanism to store API responses and reduce latency  
- Pagination support for browsing PokÃ©mon locations  
- Ability to catch, inspect, and list PokÃ©mon in your personal PokÃ©dex  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.18 or later

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jeffe89/Pokedex.git
cd Pokedex
go run main.go
```

## Usage
Start the application and use the following REPL commands:

- `help` â€“ List all available commands  
- `map` â€“ View current location and available areas  
- `mapb` â€“ Move back one page in map listings  
- `explore <location>` â€“ Explore a location for wild PokÃ©mon  
- `catch <pokemon>` â€“ Attempt to catch a PokÃ©mon  
- `inspect <pokemon>` â€“ View details of a caught PokÃ©mon  
- `pokedex` â€“ List caught PokÃ©mon  
- `exit` â€“ Quit the REPL

- `mapCommand(cfg *config)`  
  Fetches and displays the current paginated list of locations from the PokÃ©API.

- `mapbCommand(cfg *config)`  
  Navigates backward one page in location listings.

- `exploreCommand(cfg *config, args []string)`  
  Retrieves PokÃ©mon available at a specified location.

- `catchCommand(cfg *config, args []string)`  
  Attempts to catch a PokÃ©mon and store it in the local PokÃ©dex.

- `inspectCommand(cfg *config, args []string)`  
  Displays detailed information (height, weight, stats) of a caught PokÃ©mon.

- `pokedexCommand(cfg *config)`  
  Lists all PokÃ©mon the user has successfully caught.

### internal/pokecache/pokecache.go
- `NewCache(interval time.Duration)`  
  Creates a new timed cache for storing API data.

- `Add(key string, value []byte)`  
  Stores data in the cache under a specific key.
